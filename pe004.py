Project Euler Problem #4: Largest palindrome product
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Solution approach:
The largest number would be 6-digits: abccba = p*q
p * q = 100000*a + 10000*b + 1000*c + 100*c + 10*b + 1*a
p * q = 100001*a + 10010*b + 1100*c
p * q = 11*(9091*a + 910*b + 100*c)
Thus, either p or q must be divisible by 11
